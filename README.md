# Dummy bombardier
![Bombardier in Action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codesenberg/bombardier/master/img/logo.png)

In this dummy test, I am using the Bombardier tool to stress test a simple REST API that has been implemented in the Go programming language. This repository provides a structured environment for conducting performance and load testing on the API. 

The API was built using the Go Gin framework.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the testing environment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/bombardier-api-testing.git`

2. Make sure you have Docker installed on your local machine.

3. Move to the docker directory

4. Run the docker containers
 `docker-compose up`
